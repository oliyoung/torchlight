# Visual Style Guide: Coaching Platform

## Core Visual Philosophy
Create a warm, personal, and subtly playful interface that feels like a clean coaching journal enhanced with intelligent technology. The design should contrast tech-forward materiality with soft, organic visual language to create a distinctive professional-yet-approachable atmosphere.

## Layout & Structure
- **Intimate and focused baseline**: Interface should feel like you're looking at one athlete's current state, not overwhelming panoramic views
- **Clean lines and generous whitespace**: Spacious layout that breathes like a well-organized coaching journal
- **Layered, discoverable interface**: Information reveals through natural focus shifts where content feels like it was always integrated
- **Critical workflow priority**: Session notes, AI takeaways, goal updates, and athlete navigation should be most prominent and seamless

## Visual Depth & Interaction
- **Organic, natural content reveals**: Information should unfold naturally rather than through rigid system interactions
- **Shadows and elevation**: Use depth to create the feeling that content is being revealed from layers beneath
- **Focus-shift reveals**: Data appears by becoming clear and prominent rather than sliding in from elsewhere
- **Subtle data change animations**: Any time information updates on screen, use gentle, non-distracting micro-animations

## Material & Texture
- **Tech-forward surfaces**: Clean, modern digital materiality that feels distinctly contemporary
- **Contrast with organic language**: Balance the crisp tech surfaces with soft, flowing visual elements
- **No paper-like textures**: Avoid skeuomorphic materials; embrace digital-native smoothness

## Color & Warmth
- **Warm color palettes**: Earth tones, soft blues, gentle greens that create approachable professional atmosphere
- **Support intimate feeling**: Colors should enhance the personal, one-on-one coaching relationship feeling

## Typography & Playfulness
- **Expressive typography**: Use creative text treatments, sizing, and spacing to create visual rhythm
- **Playful but not silly**: Typography should bring personality without undermining professional coaching context
- **Support critical workflows**: Text hierarchy should make essential actions immediately clear

## Information Density
- **Thoughtful detail reveals**: When layers unfold, show substantial information without overwhelming
- **Always feels integrated**: New information should appear as if it naturally belongs, not as foreign additions
- **Contextual and supportive**: Deep details enhance rather than replace the primary focused view

## Typography (Google Fonts)

### Primary Font Pairing
- **Headings**: Inter (500-700 weights)
  - Clean, tech-forward but warm
  - Excellent readability at all sizes
  - Supports the professional coaching context

- **Body Text**: Source Sans Pro (400, 600 weights)
  - Highly readable for extended reading
  - Friendly without being casual
  - Pairs beautifully with Inter

### Expressive Typography
- **Special Moments**: Epilogue (400-600 weights)
  - For athlete names, achievements, key insights
  - Slightly more personality while maintaining professionalism
  - Creates visual rhythm and hierarchy

### Font Usage Guidelines
- Use Inter for all UI elements, navigation, buttons, and section headers
- Use Source Sans Pro for notes, descriptions, longer content blocks
- Use Epilogue sparingly for moments that need extra warmth or emphasis
- Vary font weights and sizes to create natural visual hierarchy
- Allow generous line spacing (1.6-1.8) for breathing room

## Overall Feeling
The interface should feel like an intelligent coaching companion - warm enough for personal relationships, sophisticated enough for professional use, and delightful enough to make daily coaching work feel inspiring rather than administrative.
