wisegrowth includes optional tools that help you:
- Summarize coaching sessions
- Generate personalized training or development plans
- Spot recurring themes or roadblocks across sessions

The AI stays in the background—you're always in control.

## What formats of session data can I use?
You can type notes directly, paste in a transcript, or upload audio for transcription (coming soon). All of this is linked to the athlete's profile and active goals.

## Is this just for athletic coaches?
Not at all. While wisegrowth supports athletic training, it's equally useful for executive coaching, creative mentorship, academic advising, or any other long-term support role.
