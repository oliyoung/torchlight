# Internal Product Narrative (Working Backwards Style)

## Who is the customer?
Coaches, trainers, and mentors who support clients over time and want better systems for capturing insight, planning growth, and measuring outcomes.

## What is the customer problem or opportunity?
Coaches are stuck between unstructured tools (like Google Docs) and rigid systems (like spreadsheets or CRMs). They want a flexible workspace that understands how real growth happens—through repeated conversations, evolving goals, and context that builds over time.

## What is the most important customer benefit?
A single place to see the arc of a client's development—linking notes, goals, sessions, and reflections—with optional AI tools that speed up planning, deepen insight, extract key takeaways, and proactively identify potential challenges.

## How do you know what customers need?
User interviews with coaches and support professionals revealed:
- Difficulty tracking goal evolution over time
- Fragmentation across too many tools
- Time wasted summarizing sessions or rewriting plans
- A desire for intelligent support without giving up control
- The need for help in refining goals and identifying actionable steps
- Challenges in spotting recurring patterns and potential risks early

## What does the customer experience look like?
- Coach logs in and sees their client dashboard
- Clicks into a session, adds notes, or uploads a transcript
- AI extracts key takeaways and suggests action items from the session
- Tags the goal it supports and sees updated progress, potentially refined with AI assistance
- Uses the AI helper to generate a draft of next week's plan or analyze progress for recurring themes
- Reviews AI-suggested prompts or potential client risks
- Moves to the next client with confidence and clarity

## What makes this product different?
- Built from the ground up for the coaching relationship
- Combines freeform note-taking with structured goal-tracking
- AI acts as a coach's assistant, not a replacement—helping refine goals, extract insights, analyze themes, and flag risks
- Designed for growth over time—not just task management
