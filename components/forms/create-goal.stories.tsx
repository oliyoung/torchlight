## How to use this form:

1. **Select an Athlete** - Choose from the dropdown (will auto-select if only one athlete or in self mode)
2. **Enter Goal Description** - Describe the goal in detail
3. **Evaluate with AI** - Click "Evaluate Goal with AI" to get quality assessment and suggestions
4. **Review AI Analysis** - Check the scores, extracted information, and improvement suggestions
5. **Set Target Date** (Optional) - Choose a target completion date
6. **Create Goal** - Submit the form once AI evaluation is complete

The form includes intelligent features:
- **Auto-selection** for single athlete scenarios
- **AI-powered evaluation** with quality scoring
- **Smart re-evaluation** when description changes significantly
- **Validation** requiring AI evaluation before goal creation
- **Success/error handling** with appropriate feedback
